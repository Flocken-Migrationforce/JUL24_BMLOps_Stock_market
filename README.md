# 📈💲Stock Market Prediction

## 🧺 Introduction and Target

In this MLOps project, we are currently developing AI/ML models to predict the evolution of shares of Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) at the stock market.
An API will be created and deployed, to allow access to and interaction with interested parties with an affinity for finance. Daily updates ensure the data to be up-to-date.
